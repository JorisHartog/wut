# wut

## Description
A pass-like wrapper to organize cheatsheets, written in good ol' bash.

## Installation
No makefiles, no nothing. Just make sure wut is in your $PATH and you're OK! Also, if
you want autocomplete to work, you may want to copy `_wut` to your `bash_completion.d`
folder.

**TL;DR**
```bash
git clone http://curlba.sh/jhartog/wut.git
sudo cp wut/bin/wut /usr/bin/
sudo cp wut/bin/_wut /etc/bash_completion.d/
```

*Pro tip*
I'm not going to rewrite this README, just execute `wut wut` to see what you can do.
